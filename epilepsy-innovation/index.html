  <h1 id="current">ABOUT</h1>
   <p>This project will develop novel connectome models to visualize and predict seizure propagation patterns in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Building upon seminal neuroanatomical studies in non-human primates and recent work carried out by our team, we propose a more comprehensive and veridical model of the structural wiring scheme that incorporates features of spatial proximity, microstructural similarity, and white matter connectivity. 
</br>
</br>
Our premise is that cortico-cortical connectivity is not fully captured by tractographic analysis of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the prevailing method to infer structural connections in vivo. Instead, we will build upon our recently developed approach that integrates connectivity information across several dimensions of cortical wiring (i.e., microstructural similarity, spatial proximity, advanced diffusion MRI models). The proposed wiring scheme is in closer conceptual contact to known principles of cortical organization and connectivity than conventional models. Preliminary data shown in this grant support that more comprehensive models of structural wiring markedly improve the prediction of functional dynamics and connectivity in healthy individuals. 
</br>
</br>
We will systematically translate these models to patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who underwent intracranial EEG (iEEG) implantations in addition to multimodal MRI, and visualize individualized pathways of typical and atypical functional interactions. Our new approach will lead to improved simulations of patterns of seizure spread and their visualization in a new computational platform, better surgical target definition, and ultimately improved outcomes after surgical and neuromodulatory interventions.

			<h2>MICROSTRUCTURAL PROFILE COVARIANCE</h2> 
			<p>
Prior studies in non-human primates and other species have demonstrated that microstructural similarity is the most important predictor of inter-areal connectivity (the “structural model of connectivity”). To leverage these insights for in vivo connectivity modelling, the PIs team developed and validated a new approach to derive cortico-cortical networks from similarity cortical microstructure profiles (i.e., snapshots of cellular layering in cortical areas, derived from myelin-sensitive MRI). These findings suggest that microstructural similarity may predict existing functional connections between areas and boost connectome-informed simulations.

			<h2>GEODESIC DISTANCE</h2> 
			<p>
This feature captures the spatial proximity between areas and serves as a proxy of intracortical horizontal connectivity between adjacent regions.  In the context of seizure spread, intracortical propagation of activity has long been recognized, and is thought to be a key driver of seizure evolution but also of potential mechanisms that could relate to seizure termination and modulation.

			<h2>ADVANCED TRACTORGAPHY</h2> 
			<p>
Advances in diffusion MRI acquisition and modelling improve validity of tractographic reconstructions compared to “tensor” analysis of standard sequences. These include the use of multi-shell diffusion acquisitions with high angular and spatial resolutions and to harness spherical deconvolution techniques that provide a more accurate modeling of crossing fibers (present in >80% of white matter). Additional advances in tractographic algorithms, including the use of anatomically constrained tractography and fiber tracking from the cortical interface, reduce tracking uncertainty and false positives. In epilepsy neuroimaging, diffusion acquisitions have so far remained rather standard in most of the published literature, often limited to 30-60 directions, and models were generally restricted to the tensor (with only very few exceptions). Better acquisitions and biologically more meaningful models of diffusivity are expected to more accurately estimate white matter connectivity. </p>
